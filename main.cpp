Description:    Using the "1 in 60 rule", 
                we will calculate track error and correction 
                error for an airplane in flight. These calculations
                are not completely accurate (rounding and precision);
                however, since even a skilled pilot cannot manually fly 
                with better than about 2Â° accuracy, and winds are constantly 
                varying, the rule remains useful for most realistic situations.
